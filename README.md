# ReinvestmentController

Reinvestment controller for Aave v4. Sweeps idle USDC out of the Hub, deposits it into
Circle's Gateway, and reclaims it on demand.

Deployed behind a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`. Protocol addresses are immutable on the
implementation; limits and roles are set in `initialize`.

## Flow

- `invest` — sweeps from the Hub and deposits into the Gateway wallet
- `divest` — mints against a Circle attestation and reclaims to the Hub
- `initiateWithdrawal` / `withdraw` — on-chain exit path, subject to the Gateway's delay
- `isValidSignature` — ERC-1271, authorises burn intents signed by a `KEEPER_ROLE` holder

How much can be invested is bounded by the absolute exposure cap, the exposure cap in BPS of
supplied assets, and a liquid buffer of Hub liquidity that must stay idle. Set the absolute exposure
cap to zero to sunset.

## Fee accounting

The Gateway debits `amount + fee` when Circle burns, but mints only `amount`. Left alone,
each divest leaves the Hub's `swept` figure overstating the balance actually recoverable at
the Gateway. That is not just an unrecoverable balance: `swept` is counted at face value in
the Hub's `totalAddedAssets`, so the gap prices into supplier shares as phantom assets, and
the Hub has no way to write it down — `reportDeficit` is spoke-only and untied to `swept`.

So `divest` pre-pays: the caller transfers `maxFee` in, and the controller reclaims
`amount + maxFee`. The pre-payment is `maxFee` regardless of what Circle actually charges,
because a lower fee is not knowable on-chain — Circle attests before it burns, and neither the
attestation nor the transfer spec carries a fee. Circle sets the fee at burn time and may not
charge the full `maxFee`. Any difference stays in the Gateway, leaving it holding more than
`swept` rather than less — the opposite of the phantom-asset case above, and the safe
direction. `initiateWithdrawal` caps
its withdrawal at `swept`, so neither that residue nor a third-party `depositFor` donation can
block the exit.

`setMaxFee` only works while paused. `divest` pre-pays the cap in force when it runs, but
Circle charges against the cap in force when the burn intent was signed, and nothing on-chain
links the two. Pausing stops new validations and stops `divest` consuming attestations while
the cap changes, but it does not cancel intents already attested (see Trust assumptions). To
lower the cap, let outstanding intents settle through `divest` first, then pause and lower.
Raising it needs no draining, since it only over-funds the Hub.

The attestation names **the controller** as `destinationRecipient`, not the Hub. Minting
straight to the Hub would remove the transfer, but `Hub.reclaim` only checks that the Hub's
aggregate balance covers `liquidity + amount` — a floor any USDC sitting there satisfies,
whatever its origin. Routing through the controller keeps the chain self-verifying: it
receives exactly `amount`, transfers exactly `amount + maxFee`, reclaims the same, each step
proven by its own balance rather than by a balance coincidence at the Hub. It also keeps
`_validateTransferSpec` pinning depositor, recipient, signer and destination caller all to
`self`, which is what makes the spec check easy to audit.

## Trust assumptions

The Gateway is Circle's. We depend on them for:

- **Attestations.** Minting requires a payload signed by an attestation signer. The signer
  set is controlled by the minter's owner, and attestations are obtained off-chain via
  Circle's API. Transaction size limit is imposed by the API.
- **Burns.** Circle burns an intent only after observing its mint in a finalized block, so a
  burn always follows a `divest`. The controller cannot observe or enforce this ordering.
- **Batch adjustments.** A signer registered by the wallet's owner can debit the controller's
  Gateway balance through `submitBatch`, with no signature from us and no burn intent. The
  controller never registers such a signer and cannot decline one, since the debit path checks
  only that the signer is registered. Batches must net to zero across depositors, so balance
  moves rather than disappears, and debits can reach funds pending withdrawal.
- **Withdrawal delay.** The on-chain exit delay is the wallet's `withdrawalDelay`, owner
  controlled. The controller does not enforce its own.
- **Pausing and denylisting.** Circle can pause either contract, denylist the controller,
  or drop USDC support. Any of these halts `invest`, `divest` or `withdraw`.
- **Upgradeability.** Both the wallet and the minter are upgradeable by Circle. This contract is
  upgradeable in case it needs to be updated post Circle upgrade.

On the Aave side, only governance can attach or detach the controller, via
`Hub.updateAssetConfig`. It cannot be detached while the asset still has a swept balance.

The keeper is trusted not to manipulate the Hub's balances to get around the relative limits.
`getInvestableAmount` reads supplied assets and idle liquidity at call time, so a keeper that
temporarily inflates them, for example by supplying flash-borrowed USDC in the same transaction,
can invest beyond what `exposureCapBps` and `liquidBufferBps` would otherwise allow. Those two
are policy limits, meant to stop an honest keeper from stranding liquidity, not a defense against
the keeper itself. `exposureCapAbs` does not depend on any balance that can move within a
transaction, so it is the hard bound on how much can ever sit at the Gateway, and it is the
parameter to set conservatively.

Note that `isValidSignature` is a view function and cannot record what it has signed for.
Multiple burn intents are each validated against the same balance; the wallet's own
accounting is what prevents over-burning.

A pause or a `KEEPER_ROLE` revocation cannot invalidate a signature Circle's TEE has already
issued. `isValidSignature` is not called again at burn time: `gatewayBurn` accepts a registered
TEE signer's signature as proof the TEE validated the intent against a quorum of RPCs. RPC lag
also means the TEE may briefly approve against pre-pause state. This is inherent to Gateway's
ERC-1271 support. Because Circle burns only after a finalized mint, and every mint goes through
`divest`, a pause also holds back the burn of any intent not yet minted; it resumes once
unpaused. A burn whose mint already finalized still lands, which settles accounting `divest`
already recorded. During an on-chain exit, `initiateWithdrawal` caps at `swept`, which leaves
exactly that pending burn in the available balance. Intents signed
before a `setMaxFee` change stay mintable after unpause, which is why the cap must be drained
before it is lowered.

## Usage

```shell
forge build
forge test
```

The gas snapshots in `tests/gas` call `vm.snapshotGasLastFrame`, which needs a recent Foundry.
If it reports an unknown cheatcode, update with `foundryup`.

Fork tests run against mainnet and need `RPC_MAINNET` set in `.env`.
